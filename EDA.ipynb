I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their “top end of town” mates.\\r\\n\\r\\nI call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nA born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&amp;Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while \"on the road\", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.\\r\\n\\r\\nMessing about on boats is one of my passions. I have a 7.2 m (24') yacht moored nearby on the harbour and know a lot about the nice parts of our extensive waterways, including its part in Australian history.  I love sharing tips on how to see the best of the harbour, using inexpensive public ferries, plus strolls around Cremorne Point from Mosman Bay, or the 3 - 4 hour walk from the Spit to Manly, via Sydney Harbour National Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy major work project now is as a volunteer Director of the Keeping Place centre for aboriginal art, culture and history.

I am both an airbnb host and traveller. By day I work as a doctor and rent out my inner Sydney city loft when traveling myself for work or holidays. I love that this allows me to help share our beautiful harbour city with guests from all over the world.  As a traveller, I seek out experiences that offer me a glimpse into what local life is like in the places I visit.   \n",
       "3  Faber est suae quisquae fortunae\\r\\n\\r\\nWe became Airbnb.com hosts back in December 2010.   I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their “top end of town” mates.\\r\\n\\r\\nI call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nA born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. \\r\\n\\r\\nStudio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while \"on the road\", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.\\r\\n\\r\\nMessing about on boats is one of my passions. I have a 7.2 m (24') yacht moored nearby on the harbour and know a lot about the nice parts of our extensive waterways, including its part in Australian history.  I love sharing tips on how to see the best of the harbour, using inexpensive public ferries, plus strolls around Cremorne Point from Mosman Bay, or the 3 - 4 hour walk from the Spit to Manly, via Sydney Harbour National Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy major work project now is as a volunteer Director of the Keeping Place centre for aboriginal art, culture and history.  Our biggest challenge is finding a permanent physical home for 2000+ pieces of art and sculpture, plus 200,000+ photographs!   \n",
