# Investigating the Impact of Airbnb on Sydney's Housing Market
Australia is currently experiencing a significant rental housing crisis, particularly in major urban centres such as Sydney. In this context, understanding the influence of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb on local housing markets is of critical importance to both policymakers and the general public. This study seeks to explore the extent to which the proliferation of Airbnb listings may be contributing to reduced housing availability and increased unaffordability within the Sydney metropolitan area.

A central research question guiding this investigation is:
Should policymakers consider implementing restrictions or caps on the number of Airbnb listings permitted within Local Government Areas (LGAs)?

This analysis is intended to contribute to the broader discourse on urban housing policy by offering empirical evidence on the role of Airbnb in shaping local housing dynamics.
